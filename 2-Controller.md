# **Instructions**

* Implement the logic to control the two functional paths. As with the "search" logic, you should start with pseudocode.

  * This implementation requires you to read and save information. Be sure to `require` the appropriate Node package.

  * Create a constructor. This constructor should return an object with two methods:

    1. accept a `name` and `location`, search the weather for the location, and save the user's information (*__not the results__*) in a log of all searches users have made thus far. 

    2. log (or return) all of the previous searches. Remember to format the date. (It's simple, and it only takes a... _moment_!)

  * Test the constructor by feeding it mock data for now.
