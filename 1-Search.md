# **Instructions**

* Implement the logic for finding the weather. You should begin planning with pseudocode (i.e. English).

  * The implementation should use the `weather-js` NPM package. Take a moment to research and experiment with the API, documented here: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/weather-js>

  * Create a constructor. It should accept a user's name and location as arguments, and store the value of `Date.now()` in a `date` property. We will format the timestamp when we display it.

  * Objects returned by the constructor should also have a method to retrieve the weather data. It should log (or return) the weather data for the location provided.

  * Test your constructor by feeding it mock data for now.
